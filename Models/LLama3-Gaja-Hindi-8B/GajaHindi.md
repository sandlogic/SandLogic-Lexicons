## LLama3-Gaja-Hindi-8B-v0.1

### Overview

LLama3-Gaja-Hindi-8B-v0.1 is an extension of the Ambari series, a bilingual English/Hindi model developed and released by **Cognitivelab.in**. This model is specialized for natural language understanding tasks, particularly in the context of instructional pairs. Built upon the **Llama3 8b** architecture, it has undergone fine-tuning with a curated dataset of translated instructional pairs.

### Prompt Format

The full prompt structure is as follows:
```bash
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
{{ system_prompt }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
{{ user_message_1 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
{{ model_answer_1 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
{{ user_message_2 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```
### Bilingual Instruct Fine-tuning

The model underwent a pivotal stage of supervised fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation, focusing on bilingual instruct fine-tuning. This approach involved training the model to respond adeptly in either English or Hindi based on the language specified in the user prompt or instruction.

### Intended Use

LLama3-Gaja-Hindi-8B-v0.1 is designed for a variety of natural language understanding tasks, with a focus on bilingual applications. Potential use cases include:

1. **Bilingual Conversational AI**: Developing chatbots or virtual assistants that can seamlessly switch between English and Hindi.

2. **Language Learning Tools**: Creating interactive platforms for users learning either English or Hindi, with the ability to provide explanations in both languages.

3. **Content Translation**: Assisting in the translation of content between English and Hindi, particularly for instructional or educational materials.

4. **Cross-lingual Information Retrieval**: Enabling users to query information in one language and receive responses in either English or Hindi.

5. **Cultural Context Understanding**: Helping users understand cultural nuances and context-specific language usage in both English and Hindi-speaking environments.

6. **Multilingual Customer Support**: Powering customer service applications that can handle queries in both languages, improving accessibility for a diverse user base.

It's important to note that while the model is designed for these applications, users should be aware of its limitations and potential biases. Always validate the model's outputs, especially for critical or sensitive applications.
