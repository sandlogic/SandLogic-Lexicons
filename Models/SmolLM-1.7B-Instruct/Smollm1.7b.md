
## SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct

We have quantized the SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct model into three variants:

1. Q5_KM
2. Q4_KM
3. IQ4_XS

These quantized models offer improved efficiency while maintaining performance.

## Original Model Information

- **Name**: SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct
- **Model Type**: Small language model
- **Parameters**: 1.7 billion
- **Training Data**: SmolLM-Corpus (curated high-quality educational and synthetic data)

## Model Capabilities

SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct is designed for various natural language processing tasks, with capabilities including:

- General knowledge question answering
- Creative writing
- Basic Python programming

## Finetuning Details

The model was finetuned on a mixture of datasets, including:

- 2k simple everyday conversations generated by llama3.1-70B
- Magpie-Pro-300K-Filtered
- StarCoder2-Self-OSS-Instruct
- A small subset of OpenHermes-2.5

## Limitations

- English language only
- May struggle with arithmetic, editing tasks, and complex reasoning
- Generated content may not always be factually accurate or logically consistent
- Potential biases from training data

## Intended Use

1. **Educational Assistance**: Helping students with general knowledge questions and basic programming concepts.
2. **Creative Writing Aid**: Assisting in generating ideas or outlines for creative writing projects.
3. **Conversational AI**: Powering chatbots for simple, everyday conversations.
4. **Code Completion**: Providing suggestions for basic Python programming tasks.
5. **General Knowledge Queries**: Answering straightforward questions on various topics.

## Model Variants

We offer three quantized versions of the SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct model:

1. **Q5_KM**: 5-bit quantization using the KM method
2. **Q4_KM**: 4-bit quantization using the KM method
3. **IQ4_XS**: 4-bit quantization using the IQ4_XS method

These quantized models aim to reduce model size and improve inference speed while maintaining performance as close to the original model as possible.
